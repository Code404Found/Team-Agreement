# Team-Agreement

## Authors: Bianca Chery, Anya Fleming, Gerard Johnson, Justine Oyaghiro

### Cooperation Plan
   
*What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
**Justine**: Wireframe, CSS, HTML, Git
**Bianca**: HTML, CSS, Images, ACP
**Anya**: Design and styling; CSS, HTML
**Gerard**: Images, Heading, CSS, Text, HTML, Spacing, Font

*How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
**Gerard**: These strengths are useful to help get a good head start and blueprint or outline how the rest of the project will look. It will also be useful for any debugging needed. 
**Bianca**: I can best utilize these strengths by providing clear, concise and neatly placed HTML, adding creative color and font styles to the text and providing an intricate way to have users interact.
**Anya**: I will utilize my strengths by adding the necessary information that I am most confident within the project.
**Justine**: I will utilize my skills in wireframe to build a starting format for the project.

*In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
**Bianca**: The professional competencies that I’d like to develop strength in, would be public speaking first and foremost. Decision making, and personal motivation. 
**Gerard**: Working on problem solving  and confidence would be competencies that I would want to work on. 
**Anya**: I would like to develop better Problem solving and independence.
**Justine**: I want to develop greater strength in public speaking and confidence.

*Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
**Anya**: When starting each day off, I believe each group member should discuss their goals for the project at least for 5 minutes. Maybe do a little brainstorming and put all of our ideas together to execute.
**Gerard**: The best course of action would be to take each concept section by section and confirm that everyone is on the same page before moving forward. We can confirm what section plays to our strengths and go from there.
**Justine**: While we all have our own portion of the project to work on, each of us should make sure we are actively collaborating with each other.
**Bianca**: The best course is to have hands-on, daily checks of where everyone is on their parts, have set deadlines for when certain smaller tasks can be done, to ease our minds from applying too much at once. 

### Conflict Plan 

*What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Stop all typing in the coding space to address the conflict. Refer back to the github team workflow to get instructions on how to fix any coding. 

*What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
We are all overwhelmed, so we will not be racing to take over on anyone else. The best steps we will be taking are reaching out and helping each other.

*How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We will work together by explaining each line of code to reassure that everyone understands.

*How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Make a note to ask everyone if help is needed, start our stand-up meetings by asking if there are any issues or challenges our fellow team members may have happening.

*How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Our group will escalate a conflict to our teachers if all troubleshooting has been exhausted. 

### Communication Plan

We will have a stand-up meeting at the beginning of each session.

*How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
We all mesh well, and have worked together on our coding during class before. We allow everyone the space to speak openly and freely.

### Work Plan

*How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
We will use GitHub projects to manage workflow and tasks, and daily check-ins.

*What project management tool will be used?
Github Projects

### GitHub Process

*What components of your project will live on GitHub? 
Wireframe, Repo, Planning Process, User Stories

*How will you share the repository with your teammates?
We will be assigned as collaborators, so we will all have access to it. It will be shared through an invite link.

*What is your Git flow?
Our init would be the start up, we would like to add in some code, push and request pulls on our branch, review and merge pull requests. Notify that merge is complete with group members. Make sure every group member has up to date repo information. 

*Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

How many people must review a PR?
We will have one person review the PR

*Who merges PRs?
Justine or Anya

*How often will you merge?
At least three times per session of coding.

*How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
Send a group notification that PR has been completed.
